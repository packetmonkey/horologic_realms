# General Rules

**Remember:** We are here to play a fun game _together_ and the enjoyment of
the group is more important than the indulgence of a specific player.

- No PvP
- No stealing from other characters
- No evil characters
- No Antiheros (Wolverine characters)
- No major 'secrets' (you are secretly killing people)

In general, don't be a jerk.

## The standard party
Custom adventures will be written against the assumption of the 'standard' D&D
party consisting of

- A Wizard
- A Ranger
- A Fighter
- A Cleric
- A Rogue

Any deviation from that list by players may result in some outside-the-box
encounters. This goes both ways in the sense that if you have 5
clerics/paladins I'm not going to artificially increase the difficulty of
undead encounters because you should be rewarded with an easy encounter because
of your past decisions. Good luck sneaking your way though a dense elf grove
however.

## Dungeon Delving
Unless a particular encounter is complex enough to warrant it, the majority
of the game is played without a battle mat. In addition, a high-level overview
of explored areas of the dungeon are not given either. You may wish to take
a feat such as Keen Mind or draw a map as you explore to maintain orientation.

## Meta Gaming
Meta gaming isn't bad and you should use what you know to try and accomplish
your goals. I'll assume that the party members are experienced enough with
in-game lore to know vampires don't react well to sunlight even if they
haven't personally seen it before. If I don't want you to know something
about a monster, I'll create a new one and not tell you about it ahead of time.
You don't have to worry about what you know vs what your character knows. This
also plays into not being a jerk with no major secrets so nobody has to pretend
they don't notice the thief stealing from the wizard when he is on watch.

## Skills are useful
My games value and reward the full range of character options. The reason
searching for traps takes so long is because if you want it to take less time,
you should take Dungeon Delver. If you don't want to risk getting lost in the
forest, ensure you have a qualified ranger with you. If the adventuring party
is made entirely of combat focused characters, the campaign will be difficult.

## Character conception
Half-Orcs, Half-Elves, and all characters, player or otherwise are always
willingly conceived. No exceptions.

## Creating a character
You may generate attribute scores by either rolling `4d6r1d1` or using the point
buy system described on PHB:13.
