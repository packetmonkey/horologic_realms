The Horologic Realms are divinely ruled by what the 5th edition DMG calls the
`Dawn War Dieties` (DMG:10) with a lot of lore pulled from the adventures
published in earlier editions of D&D.

Deities in the realm derive their power from sacrifices among other sources and
are merely sufficiency powerful creatures. There is no 'divine spark' or
additional mechanic in play.

There are many racial, local, or otherwise niche lesser and quasi-deities.
Most of them derive their power from that particular group or from one of
the listed known greater deities. For example, Halflings recognize
Yondalla as their patron deity while still recognizing the impact of Pelor
on their daily life.
